# Todo-List
***This project is not complete and needs edit/display functionality for todos***  
This project was completed for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript Todo List Assignment.  

The aim of this project is to make a functional single page todo list app using WebPack to bundle files, JS to dynamically render content, and OOP principles (SOLID).  

## Built With
* Vanilla JS
* HTML5
* CSS3
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Live Demo
[Todo List](https://jacoberson.github.io/Todo-List/)

## How to Run
In order to setup and work on this project, you need to:
1. Clone this repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/Jacoberson/Todo-List.git`
   
2. Install required dependencies:  
   `npm install`
   
3. Start a live demo:  
   `npm start`

### Usage
**Once opened, projects and todos can be added**
* There is a default project already created
* Adding todos will add to the current selected project
* Todos are color coded based on priority
* Todos can be marked complete (will add strikethrough)
* Todos can be deleted

## Improvements
Features I would like to add to this app:
* Edit Todos
* View Todo details
* Display badges on each project item that displays the amount of todos in that project
* Implement Local Storage or database
* Edit Projects
* Delete Projects
